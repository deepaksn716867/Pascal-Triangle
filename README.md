Pascal-Triangle
===============
A simple javascript program to print the pascal triangle with the required number of rows.

A pascal triangle start with "1" at the top, then continue placing numbers below it in a triangular pattern. 

Each number is just the two numbers above it added together (except for the edges, which are all "1").
